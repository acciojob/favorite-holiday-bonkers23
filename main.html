	<h1>Prayagraj</h1>
	<p>Prayagraj is one of the oldest cities in India. It is crowned in ancient scriptures as 'Prayag' or 'Teertharaj' and is considered the holiest of pilgrimage centres of India. It is situated at the confluence of three rivers- Ganga, Yamuna and the invisible Saraswati.

	<ol>
		<li>The meeting point or the confluence of three of the most important rivers in the Hindu religion, <b>Triveni Sangam</b>, is a holy place located in Allahabad.</li>
		<li>Formerly a burial complex near the Allahabad junction railway station, <em>Khusro Bagh</em> is currently a walled garden typical of the Mughal construction.</li>
		<li>In the 1930s, the original <i>Swaraj Bhavan</i>, today a famous Allahabad tourist place, was transformed into the headquarters of the Indian National Congress. As a result, Motilal Nehru had to buy another mansion for himself and his family to reside, and it was called Anand Bhavan.</li>
		<li>Established in 1931, the Allahabad Museum is one of the most important and <strong>grandiose museums</strong> of India.</li>
		<li>Situated beside the <strong>Anand Bhavan</strong> and built-in 1979, the Jawahar Planetarium is the perfect confluence of science and history.</li>
